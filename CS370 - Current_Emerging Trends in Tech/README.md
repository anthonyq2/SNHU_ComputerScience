# CS 370 - Current/Emerging Trends in CS

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

    **The code we were given in this project were two Python files, TreasureHunt.py and GameExperience.py, which included a maze object defined as a matrix and stored the states between the initial state and the terminal state respectively. We were also provided a Jupyter notebook with a neural net that was created to play the game defined in these two Python files. The task was to implement a Q-learning algorithm using the code provided to navigate the maze and maximize the reward. We were also tasked with determining the optimal number of epochs to achieve a 100% win rate.**

- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

        **Computer scientists use a wide spectrum of technologies to solve real-world, often repetitive, problems that are very difficult to solve by humans. This matters because computers can be programmed, or in the case of ML, trained, to solve problems that humans often find require heavy amounts of computation and are often done more accurately by machines. A perfect example of this is a computer that is able to read x-rays and, using machine learning, determine the likelihood of a patient having cancer based on comparing the x-ray to an entire database of x-rays with and without cancer in a matter of minutes or even seconds.**
    - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

        **A computer science problem should be approached from many different angles. One effective way of doing this is by asking yourself some qualifying questions when approaching a problem: What technologies are best suited to address the issue at hand? Are there existing code bases or applications I can leverage with my work to avoid "reinventing the wheel"? What ethical concerns may arise as a result of this? It is important for computer scientists to consider all of these aspects and many, many others when working on a new problem.**

    - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

        **Ethical concerns must always be taken seriously in computer science. Since the field is constantly evolving, it is important to reflect on what your responsibilities are to an end-user and an organization. More specifically, you should always be looking into the approaches you use to secure the applications or neural networks you design, only be collecting and saving user data directly related to the functionality of your app, and, if you work for an organization, always bringing up concerns you may find with an application that could put a user at risk.**
